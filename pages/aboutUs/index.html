                    <h1>The Beginning of the STI Brand</h1>
                    <p>In the early ‘80s, Augusto C. Lagman, Herman T. Gamboa, Benjamin A. Santos, and Edgar H. Sarte — four entrepreneurs and friends — came together to set up Systems Technology Institute (STI), a training center that delivers basic programming education to professionals and students who want to learn this new skill.</p>
                    <p>A unique value proposition spelled the difference for the STI brand: “First We’ll Teach You, Then We’ll Hire You.” Through its unique Guaranteed Hire Program (GHP), all qualified graduates were offered jobs by one of the founders’ companies or through their contacts in the industry.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h1>The Journey of the STI Brand</h1>
                    <p>Starting with the basics, the founders began with conceptualizing a logo that would best fit STI as an academic institution. The result of the brainstorming and studies is the “Owl” — a well-known symbol of wisdom. This marks the birth of the logotype and “Owlie” (the official mascot) as the first brand representation of STI. Owlie embodied the goal of STI to impart wisdom in an industry that was expanding greatly yet with evident stability.</p>
                    <p>STI began with a goal to train as many Filipinos as possible to develop their computer skills. It wanted to be known as the school that one could go to for short-term training and where graduates were geared with in-demand skills. There was such a high demand for computer professionals that even graduates of one- or two-year training programs were hired by big companies to fill their needs.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h1>Change is Constant</h1>
                    <p>Meanwhile, with the imminent infiltration of the educational landscape in IT and the need to better communicate STI’s value proposition, STI decided to support its printed advertisement materials and local events with a more direct approach to their target market. They began to formalize on-the-ground activities that zeroed in on graduating high school students.

                        This opened the doors for the Career Orientation Seminar (COS). The COS is an annual event organized by high schools where college and university representatives are invited to orient the graduating high school students on their course offerings and potential career paths. The first COS was done in 1983 among graduating high school students of Trinity College and was conducted by one of the founders, Benjamin A. Santos, with Dolly C. Cruz.</p>
                    <p>Realizing the great need to generate awareness and increase efforts to reach out to the community, STI also started to give ample focus on event-driven campaigns. Thus, a summer program called the MICRO Computing for Kids was instituted. To support the program, shirts were made for children enrolled in the class, and this was considered as the first STI proware merchandise.

                        The need to solidify its foundation, on the other hand, remained to be the primary focus of STI. Hence, in an effort to further strengthen the GHP, the “Circle of Friends” was established in 1985 which is composed of the school’s partner companies. This paved the way to more employment opportunities for the graduates.</p>
